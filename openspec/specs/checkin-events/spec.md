# checkin-events Specification

## Purpose
TBD - created by archiving change add-checkin-events. Update Purpose after archive.
## Requirements
### Requirement: AppUser checkin status is governed by a three-state machine

The system SHALL maintain a `checkin_user_status` row per AppUser containing `status: off_duty | on_site | in_transit`, `current_shift_started_at: DateTime | null`, and `last_event_id: ObjectId | null`. Newly created AppUsers SHALL start with `status = off_duty`, `current_shift_started_at = null`, `last_event_id = null`. Each successful event SHALL atomically update both the `checkin_events` row (insert) and the `checkin_user_status` row (update). The legal transitions are exactly:

| From | Event | To |
|---|---|---|
| `off_duty` | `clock_in` | `on_site` |
| `on_site` | `clock_out` | `off_duty` |
| `on_site` | `transfer_out` | `in_transit` |
| `in_transit` | `transfer_in` | `on_site` |
| `in_transit` | `clock_out` | `off_duty` |

Any other (status, event) pair SHALL be rejected with `422 INVALID_TRANSITION`. The error body SHALL include the AppUser's current `status` and the attempted `event_type`.

#### Scenario: New AppUser starts off duty

- **WHEN** an admin creates a new AppUser
- **THEN** a `checkin_user_status` row is inserted with `app_user_id`, `org_id`, `status = off_duty`, `current_shift_started_at = null`, `last_event_id = null`

#### Scenario: Successful clock_in transitions off_duty to on_site

- **WHEN** an AppUser with `status = off_duty` submits a valid `clock_in` event
- **THEN** the event is recorded with `event_type = clock_in`
- **AND** the AppUser's status row is updated to `status = on_site`, `current_shift_started_at = event.occurred_at_client`, `last_event_id = new_event.id`

#### Scenario: Successful transfer_out from on_site

- **WHEN** an AppUser with `status = on_site` submits a `transfer_out` event
- **THEN** the AppUser's status becomes `in_transit`
- **AND** `current_shift_started_at` is unchanged (the shift continues across transfers)

#### Scenario: Successful transfer_in from in_transit

- **WHEN** an AppUser with `status = in_transit` submits a `transfer_in` event
- **THEN** the AppUser's status returns to `on_site`
- **AND** the event represents arrival at the next worksite (location captured per-event); the system does NOT compare the location against the original `clock_in` location

#### Scenario: Successful clock_out from in_transit

- **WHEN** an AppUser with `status = in_transit` submits a `clock_out` event
- **THEN** the AppUser's status becomes `off_duty`
- **AND** `current_shift_started_at` is reset to `null`

#### Scenario: Multi-site shift cycle is supported

- **WHEN** an AppUser performs `clock_in → transfer_out → transfer_in → transfer_out → transfer_in → clock_out` in chronological order
- **THEN** every transition is accepted (the AppUser visited 3 worksites in one shift)
- **AND** the final status is `off_duty`

#### Scenario: clock_in while already on shift rejected

- **WHEN** an AppUser with `status = on_site` or `status = in_transit` submits `clock_in`
- **THEN** the request is rejected with `INVALID_TRANSITION`
- **AND** no event is recorded and the status row is unchanged

#### Scenario: clock_out while off duty rejected

- **WHEN** an AppUser with `status = off_duty` submits `clock_out`
- **THEN** the request is rejected with `INVALID_TRANSITION`

#### Scenario: transfer_in from on_site rejected

- **WHEN** an AppUser with `status = on_site` submits `transfer_in`
- **THEN** the request is rejected with `INVALID_TRANSITION`

#### Scenario: transfer_out from in_transit rejected

- **WHEN** an AppUser with `status = in_transit` submits `transfer_out`
- **THEN** the request is rejected with `INVALID_TRANSITION`

### Requirement: Each event records dual timestamps and a location

The system SHALL store every event with `occurred_at_client: DateTime` (supplied by the AppUser in the request body) and `occurred_at_server: DateTime` (set by the server on receipt). The system SHALL accept any value for `occurred_at_client` including future or past timestamps. The system SHALL NOT use `occurred_at_client` validation as a fraud filter beyond ordering rules. Display, sorting, and pagination on both `/app/checkin/*` and `/checkin/*` SHALL use `occurred_at_client` as the canonical time. Each event SHALL also store a `location` document containing `coordinates: { lat: f64, lng: f64 }` (required), `accuracy_meters: f64?` (optional), `region_name: String?` (server-set via reverse geocoding, may be `null`), and `manual_label: String?` (optional, from the request, 1–120 characters when present).

#### Scenario: Event records both client and server timestamps

- **WHEN** an AppUser submits any valid event with `occurred_at_client = T_c`
- **AND** the server receives it at wall time `T_s`
- **THEN** the stored event row has `occurred_at_client = T_c` and `occurred_at_server = T_s`

#### Scenario: Future client time accepted

- **WHEN** an AppUser submits an event with `occurred_at_client` set to one hour in the future
- **THEN** the request is accepted (subject to other validation)
- **AND** admin-web subsequently flags the event with a skew warning (see "Admin live status board" requirement)

#### Scenario: Old client time accepted (offline sync)

- **WHEN** an AppUser submits an event with `occurred_at_client` set to 6 hours in the past
- **AND** no later event exists for this AppUser
- **THEN** the request is accepted

#### Scenario: GPS coordinates required

- **WHEN** an AppUser submits an event whose request body lacks `lat` or `lng`
- **THEN** the request is rejected with `VALIDATION` (or equivalent missing-field error)

### Requirement: Events for an AppUser are strictly ordered by client time

The system SHALL, for each AppUser, reject any incoming event whose `occurred_at_client` is less than or equal to the most recent stored event's `occurred_at_client` for that AppUser. The error code SHALL be `OUT_OF_ORDER` (HTTP 409). The first event for an AppUser SHALL accept any client time. The check SHALL be scoped per AppUser; events for different AppUsers SHALL NOT interfere.

#### Scenario: Earlier-than-last event rejected

- **WHEN** an AppUser's most recent event has `occurred_at_client = 10:00`
- **AND** the AppUser submits a new event with `occurred_at_client = 09:30`
- **THEN** the request is rejected with `OUT_OF_ORDER`
- **AND** no event is recorded

#### Scenario: Equal-to-last event rejected

- **WHEN** an AppUser's most recent event has `occurred_at_client = 10:00`
- **AND** the AppUser submits a new event with `occurred_at_client = 10:00`
- **THEN** the request is rejected with `OUT_OF_ORDER`

#### Scenario: First event accepts any time

- **WHEN** an AppUser has zero stored events
- **AND** submits an event with any `occurred_at_client` (past or future)
- **THEN** the event is accepted (subject to other validation)

#### Scenario: Per-AppUser scoping

- **WHEN** AppUser A's latest event has `occurred_at_client = 10:00`
- **AND** AppUser B submits an event with `occurred_at_client = 09:00`
- **THEN** AppUser B's request is accepted (the order check is per AppUser, not Org-wide)

### Requirement: AppUser submits checkin events via /app/checkin/events

The system SHALL accept `POST /app/checkin/events` with body `{ event_type, lat, lng, accuracy?, manual_label?, occurred_at_client }`. The system SHALL run state-machine validation, transfer-toggle validation, ordering validation, attempt reverse geocoding (fail-soft, see separate requirement), insert the event, and update `checkin_user_status` atomically. On success the response SHALL be `201 Created` with `{ event, status }`.

#### Scenario: Successful event submission

- **WHEN** an authenticated AppUser sends `POST /app/checkin/events` with valid body for a legal transition
- **THEN** a new `checkin_events` row is inserted with `app_user_id`, `org_id`, `event_type`, `occurred_at_client`, `occurred_at_server = now`, `source = app`, `initiated_by_kind = app_user`, `initiated_by_id = ctx.app_user_id`, and the location document
- **AND** the AppUser's `checkin_user_status` is updated per the state-machine table
- **AND** the response is `201` with `{ event, status }`

### Requirement: AppUser fetches own status and history

The system SHALL provide `GET /app/checkin/status` returning `{ status, current_shift_started_at, last_event }` and `GET /app/checkin/events` returning a cursor-paginated list of the AppUser's own events (newest first by `occurred_at_client`, default page size 50). Both endpoints SHALL scope strictly to the caller; AppUsers SHALL NOT see another AppUser's events through this surface.

#### Scenario: AppUser fetches their own status

- **WHEN** an authenticated AppUser sends `GET /app/checkin/status`
- **THEN** the response is the caller's `checkin_user_status` row plus the resolved `last_event` document if `last_event_id` is non-null

#### Scenario: AppUser lists own events

- **WHEN** an authenticated AppUser sends `GET /app/checkin/events`
- **THEN** the response contains up to 50 of the caller's events ordered by `occurred_at_client` descending
- **AND** events belonging to other AppUsers are not included

### Requirement: Admin lists AppUser status board

The system SHALL provide `GET /checkin/users` for dashboard admins, returning every AppUser in `current_org` with their current `checkin_user_status` (including a flag indicating whether the most recent event has `|occurred_at_client - occurred_at_server| > 1 hour`). AppUsers from other Orgs SHALL NOT appear. Members (non-admin) SHALL be rejected with `FORBIDDEN`.

#### Scenario: Admin sees current_org AppUsers and their status

- **WHEN** an authenticated admin sends `GET /checkin/users`
- **THEN** the response contains an array entry for every AppUser whose `org_id == current_org_id`, each carrying `{ user, status, current_shift_started_at, last_event, has_skew_warning }`

#### Scenario: Skew warning is computed per AppUser

- **WHEN** an AppUser's most recent event has `|occurred_at_client - occurred_at_server| > 1 hour`
- **THEN** that AppUser's response entry has `has_skew_warning = true`
- **AND** when within 1 hour, `has_skew_warning = false`

#### Scenario: Cross-Org AppUsers excluded

- **WHEN** an admin sends `GET /checkin/users` while `current_org = Org A`
- **THEN** AppUsers belonging to Org B are absent regardless of status

#### Scenario: Member cannot view checkin board

- **WHEN** a `member` sends `GET /checkin/users`
- **THEN** the request is rejected with `FORBIDDEN`

### Requirement: Admin views one AppUser's event history

The system SHALL provide `GET /checkin/users/:id/events` for dashboard admins, returning the target AppUser's events (cursor-paginated, newest first by `occurred_at_client`, default page size 50). The endpoint SHALL be scoped to `current_org`; targeting an AppUser belonging to another Org SHALL return `NOT_FOUND`. Members SHALL be rejected with `FORBIDDEN`.

#### Scenario: Admin views in-org AppUser events

- **WHEN** an authenticated admin sends `GET /checkin/users/:id/events` for an AppUser in `current_org`
- **THEN** the response contains the target's events with `event_type`, `occurred_at_client`, `occurred_at_server`, location, `source`, `initiated_by_kind`, and `has_skew_warning` per event

#### Scenario: Cross-Org target rejected

- **WHEN** an admin sends `GET /checkin/users/:id/events` for an AppUser whose `org_id != current_org_id`
- **THEN** the response is `NOT_FOUND`

### Requirement: Admin can force checkout an AppUser on shift

The system SHALL provide `POST /checkin/users/:id/force-checkout` with optional body `{ reason: String? }` (≤ 240 chars). The action SHALL only succeed when the target's current `status` is `on_site` or `in_transit`; otherwise SHALL respond `409 NOT_ON_DUTY`. On success the system SHALL insert a `clock_out` event with `source = admin_force`, `initiated_by_kind = dashboard_user`, `initiated_by_id = ctx.user_id`, `occurred_at_client = occurred_at_server = now`, and `location` copied from the AppUser's last event with `manual_label = "管理員強制收班"`. The reason text SHALL be stored on the event (separate field). The endpoint SHALL be admin-only and scoped to `current_org`.

#### Scenario: Admin force-checks-out an on-shift AppUser

- **WHEN** an admin sends `POST /checkin/users/:id/force-checkout` for an AppUser in `current_org` with `status = on_site` (or `in_transit`)
- **THEN** a `clock_out` event is inserted with `source = admin_force`, `initiated_by_kind = dashboard_user`, `initiated_by_id = caller`, location copied from the AppUser's last event, and `manual_label = "管理員強制收班"`
- **AND** the AppUser's status becomes `off_duty`

#### Scenario: Optional reason is stored

- **WHEN** an admin sends `POST /checkin/users/:id/force-checkout` with body `{ "reason": "shift ended via line manager" }`
- **THEN** the inserted event's `reason` field equals `"shift ended via line manager"`

#### Scenario: Off-duty target rejected

- **WHEN** an admin sends `POST /checkin/users/:id/force-checkout` for an AppUser with `status = off_duty`
- **THEN** the request is rejected with `NOT_ON_DUTY`

#### Scenario: Cross-Org target rejected

- **WHEN** an admin sends `POST /checkin/users/:id/force-checkout` for an AppUser whose `org_id != current_org_id`
- **THEN** the response is `NOT_FOUND`

#### Scenario: Member cannot force-checkout

- **WHEN** a `member` sends `POST /checkin/users/:id/force-checkout`
- **THEN** the request is rejected with `FORBIDDEN`

### Requirement: Org transfer-enabled toggle gates transfer events

The system SHALL store `Org.settings.checkin.transfer_enabled: bool` defaulting to `true` on Org creation. When `transfer_enabled == false`, the system SHALL reject `transfer_out` and `transfer_in` events with `403 TRANSFER_DISABLED`. When `transfer_enabled == true`, transfer events are subject only to state-machine validation. The toggle SHALL NOT affect `clock_in` or `clock_out`.

#### Scenario: New Org defaults to transfer enabled

- **WHEN** a new Org is created
- **THEN** `Org.settings.checkin.transfer_enabled` is `true`

#### Scenario: Transfer event rejected when toggle is off

- **WHEN** an AppUser whose Org has `transfer_enabled = false` submits a `transfer_out` (or `transfer_in`) event
- **THEN** the request is rejected with `TRANSFER_DISABLED`
- **AND** no event is recorded

#### Scenario: clock_in / clock_out unaffected by toggle

- **WHEN** an AppUser whose Org has `transfer_enabled = false` submits a valid `clock_in` or `clock_out` event
- **THEN** the request is processed normally

### Requirement: Transfer-enabled toggle is state-locked

The system SHALL allow an admin to update either
`Org.settings.checkin.transfer_enabled` or
`Org.settings.checkin.location_tracking_enabled` via
`PATCH /orgs/me/settings` only when the count of AppUsers in
`current_org` whose `checkin_user_status.status != off_duty` is zero.
Otherwise the system SHALL respond `409 STATE_LOCKED` with body field
`on_duty_count` indicating how many AppUsers must clock out before the
toggle can change. The state-lock check SHALL fire when EITHER toggle
is present in the request body, and SHALL apply uniformly to both —
they share a single lock since the underlying concern (data
inconsistency caused by a settings flip mid-shift) is the same. Other
settings (e.g. `timezone`) SHALL NOT be subject to the state-lock.

#### Scenario: Transfer toggle change allowed when nobody is on duty

- **GIVEN** every AppUser in `current_org` has `checkin_user_status.status == off_duty`
- **AND** an admin sends `PATCH /orgs/me/settings` with `{ transfer_enabled: false }`
- **THEN** `Org.settings.checkin.transfer_enabled` becomes `false`

#### Scenario: Location tracking toggle change allowed when nobody is on duty

- **GIVEN** every AppUser in `current_org` has `checkin_user_status.status == off_duty`
- **AND** an admin sends `PATCH /orgs/me/settings` with `{ location_tracking_enabled: true }`
- **THEN** `Org.settings.checkin.location_tracking_enabled` becomes `true`

#### Scenario: Transfer toggle change blocked when someone is on duty

- **GIVEN** at least one AppUser in `current_org` has `checkin_user_status.status != off_duty`
- **AND** an admin sends `PATCH /orgs/me/settings` with a `transfer_enabled` value
- **THEN** the request is rejected with `STATE_LOCKED`
- **AND** the response body's `on_duty_count` reflects the actual count
- **AND** `Org.settings.checkin.transfer_enabled` is unchanged

#### Scenario: Location tracking toggle change blocked when someone is on duty

- **GIVEN** at least one AppUser in `current_org` has `checkin_user_status.status != off_duty`
- **AND** an admin sends `PATCH /orgs/me/settings` with a `location_tracking_enabled` value
- **THEN** the request is rejected with `STATE_LOCKED`
- **AND** the response body's `on_duty_count` reflects the actual count
- **AND** `Org.settings.checkin.location_tracking_enabled` is unchanged

#### Scenario: Both toggles in one request, lock applies to the whole patch

- **GIVEN** at least one AppUser in `current_org` is non-`off_duty`
- **AND** an admin sends `PATCH /orgs/me/settings` with both `transfer_enabled` and `location_tracking_enabled` values in the body
- **THEN** the request is rejected with `STATE_LOCKED` (no partial application — both fields are atomic with respect to the lock)
- **AND** neither toggle is updated

#### Scenario: Timezone change not blocked by state-lock

- **GIVEN** at least one AppUser in `current_org` is non-`off_duty`
- **AND** an admin sends `PATCH /orgs/me/settings` with `{ timezone: "America/Los_Angeles" }`
- **THEN** the timezone is updated normally (no state-lock applies)

#### Scenario: Timezone + toggle in same patch fall under state-lock

- **GIVEN** at least one AppUser in `current_org` is non-`off_duty`
- **AND** an admin sends `PATCH /orgs/me/settings` with both `timezone` and one of the toggles
- **THEN** the request is rejected with `STATE_LOCKED` (toggle presence pulls the whole patch under the lock)

#### Scenario: Member cannot update settings

- **WHEN** a `member` sends `PATCH /orgs/me/settings` with any body
- **THEN** the request is rejected with `403 FORBIDDEN`

### Requirement: Reverse geocoding is fail-soft and abstracted via a trait

The system SHALL define a `ReverseGeocoder` interface with a single async method that accepts `(lat, lng)` and returns an optional human-readable region label. The system SHALL ship one implementation backed by Nominatim (or equivalent free service) configured with a fixed bandao User-Agent and a 2-second per-request timeout, requesting `zoom=17` and `addressdetails=1`. The implementation SHALL compose the returned label as `"{district} · {road}"` when both an administrative district label (preferring `suburb` > `city` > `town` > `village` > `county` > `state` > `country`) and a `road` field are present in the structured address. When only one is present the label SHALL be that single value. When neither is present the implementation SHALL fall back to Nominatim's free-text `display_name` field, then to `null`. On any failure (timeout, non-2xx response, parse error, network error), the system SHALL store `region_name = null` on the event and SHALL still record the event normally — failure SHALL NOT cause the event-submission request to fail. The handler SHALL invoke the geocoder synchronously as part of event creation.

#### Scenario: Successful geocode with district and road composes both

- **WHEN** an AppUser submits a valid event and the geocoder returns both a district label and a `road` field
- **THEN** the stored event has `region_name` set to `"{district} · {road}"` (e.g., `"信義區 · 忠孝東路五段"`)

#### Scenario: Successful geocode with only district falls back to district

- **WHEN** an AppUser submits a valid event and the geocoder returns a district label but no `road`
- **THEN** the stored event has `region_name` set to the district label alone (e.g., `"信義區"`)

#### Scenario: Successful geocode with only road falls back to road

- **WHEN** an AppUser submits a valid event and the geocoder returns a `road` field but no district
- **THEN** the stored event has `region_name` set to the road alone (e.g., `"忠孝東路五段"`)

#### Scenario: Geocoder timeout produces null region_name

- **WHEN** the geocoder times out (≥ 2 seconds)
- **THEN** the event is still recorded with `region_name = null`
- **AND** the event-submission request returns `201 Created`

#### Scenario: Geocoder error produces null region_name

- **WHEN** the geocoder returns a non-2xx response, malformed payload, or any other error
- **THEN** the event is still recorded with `region_name = null`

#### Scenario: Manual label is preserved across geocoding outcome

- **WHEN** an AppUser submits an event with `manual_label = "公司門口"`
- **THEN** the stored `manual_label` is `"公司門口"` regardless of whether geocoding succeeded
- **AND** the optional `region_name` is set independently

### Requirement: Reverse geocoding is fronted by an in-memory LRU cache

The system SHALL wrap the production `ReverseGeocoder` in an in-memory caching layer. The cache SHALL key entries on `(lat, lng)` rounded to four decimal places (≈ 11 m grid). The cache SHALL evict entries via LRU policy when its capacity (10,000 entries) is exceeded. Each cached entry SHALL expire after a 1-hour TTL — reads after expiry SHALL be treated as a miss. The cache SHALL be transparent to callers: `lookup(lat, lng)` returns the same value (including `None`) regardless of whether the result came from the upstream geocoder or the cache. The cache SHALL be process-local and SHALL NOT persist across restarts. The test-only `StaticReverseGeocoder` SHALL NOT be cached (tests inject the static geocoder directly so they observe deterministic behavior).

#### Scenario: Repeat lookup within the same grid cell hits the cache

- **WHEN** the system has already resolved `(lat, lng)` to some label within the last hour
- **AND** another lookup arrives for coordinates rounding to the same 4-decimal key
- **THEN** the upstream Nominatim implementation is NOT called
- **AND** the cached label is returned

#### Scenario: Lookup outside the cache window misses

- **WHEN** more than 1 hour has elapsed since the last lookup for a given key
- **THEN** the next lookup with that key triggers an upstream Nominatim call
- **AND** the result replaces the expired entry

#### Scenario: Negative result is cached

- **WHEN** an upstream lookup returns `None` (geocode failure)
- **THEN** subsequent lookups for the same key within the TTL also return `None` without calling upstream

#### Scenario: Cache evicts oldest when full

- **WHEN** the cache holds 10,000 distinct keys and a new key is looked up
- **THEN** the least-recently-used entry is removed before the new entry is stored
